how do i know the plan id for the printplanstatus? - UI problem (need to print all plans or print the id for the created plan)

change the tostring of plan as per the playbook

***ignore # at config file***

***problem in facility selection in plan.step - finished constuction and continue to select the facility even though this is already built. ***
 -- maybe add check for if in facilities - if is in there dont add it and continue - problem - can enter infinite loop if no facilities to choose


implement rule of 5 to everyone that needs




facility idobank 1 3 3 2 1
facility idofact 0 2 2 1 1
facility idogarden 2 5 2 2 3
settlement idocity 1
plan idocity nve






check:
backup - seems to be working
restore - seems to be working
step - seems to be working 
	*problem in facility selection
addfacility - seems to be working
addSettlement - seems to be working
addplan - seems to be working
naiveselection - working

**did not checked edge cases**
