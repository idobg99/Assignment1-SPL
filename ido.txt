how do i know the plan id for the printPlanStatus? - UI problem (need to print all plans or print the id for the created plan)

change the toString of plan as per the instructions

***ignore # at config file***

***potential problem in facility selection in plan.step - finished construction and continue to select the facility even though this is already built. ***
 -- maybe add check for if in facilities - if is in there don't add it and continue - problem - can enter infinite loop if no facilities to choose

implement rule of 5 to everyone that needs



#CHECKED:#
backup -           working - check for correct deep copying 
restore -          working
step -             working 
	            *problem in facility selection as mentioned earlier*
addfacility -      working
addSettlement -    working
addplan -          working
naiveselection -   working
ChangePlanPolicy - Working (checked only change to nve)

**DID NOT CHECKED FOR EDGE CASES**

#NEED TO CHECK:#
other selection policies
close

edge cases check needed:
parsing config, other parsing
adding facilities and settlements - adding existing objects
plan threading - plans for the same settlement - what happens simultaneously
